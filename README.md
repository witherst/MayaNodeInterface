Maya-Node-Interface
===================

I designed this Node-based interface as a way of learning Python and PyQt.  It has been developed with Maya 2011 and only (as of now) works with Maya 2011.  It's only meant to work with setting up particle systems.  Some node functions aren't complete, but for the most part all of them are done.
